Objects are instances of the classes. Objects have properties(data) and methods(functions of the classes) defined by the class. Example: car.speed = 60; here car is an object and speed is a property of the object.
Statements is a piece of code that performs some action in the program. Statements are made with expressions that makes the statement recognizable. Also they always ends with a ;. Example: int x = 60; it's an assignment statement because it assign a value to the x.
Function is a reusable piece of code which is created to run the same code multiple times without writing it again and again. Functions are recognized by the parantheses(). Example:
void Hello() {
cout << "Hello World";
}

int main() {
Hello();
return 0;
}

in the above snippet main() and Hello() are functions.
