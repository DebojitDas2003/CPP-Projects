Relationship between Class and Object is like blueprint and building or recipe and dish.
Class(recipe or blueprint) defines the type of the object, the data it can hold and what actions can be performed on it.
Object(dish or building) is an instance of the Class. Objects are created according to the rules defined by the Class. Objects has it's own copy of data defined by the class. Objects can independently perform actions on other objects.
