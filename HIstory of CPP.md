Created by Bjarne Stroustrup(also created C in 1979 at Bell Labs).
Bjarne added Object Oriented Programming features to C and named the new language "C with Classes".
Later changed the named to C++ in 1985.
In late 1990s, the introduction of STL(Standard Template Library) made C++ more powerful, allowing the programmers to write reusable and efficient code more easily.
